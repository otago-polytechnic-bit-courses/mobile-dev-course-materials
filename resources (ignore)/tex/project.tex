\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will develop two mobile applications using \textbf{React Native} and \textbf{Expo} and publish them to \textbf{Expo Go}. In addition, marks will be allocated for code quality and best practices, documentation and \textbf{Git} usage. 

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Implement and publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural and code-quality standards.
  \item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario and incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
  \item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete majority of this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Wednesday, 13 November 2024} at \textbf{4.59 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all application files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission – \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/Nh2sKWnc}{https://classroom.github.com/a/Nh2sKWnc}. If you do not have not one, create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/VisualStudio.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/VisualStudio.gitignore}. Create a branch called \textbf{project}. The latest application files in the \textbf{project} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. Do your best to complete this assessment without using an \textbf{AI generative tool}. You need to demonstrate to the course lecturer that you can meet the learning outcome for this assessment. \\
 
 However, if you get stuck, you can use an \textbf{AI generative tool} to help you get unstuck, permitting you to acknowledge that you have used it. In the assessment's repository \textbf{README.md} file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to the \textbf{AI generative tool} and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work. It also applies to code snippets retrieved from \textbf{StackOverflow} and \textbf{GitHub}. \\
 
 Failure to do this may result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.  

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. Extensions will \textbf{only} be granted if you are unable to complete the assessment by the due date because of \textbf{unforeseen circumstances outside your control}. The length of the extension granted will depend on the circumstances and \textbf{must} be negotiated with the course lecturer before the assessment due date. A medical certificate or support letter may be needed. Extensions will not be granted for poor time management or pressure of other assessments.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments are not applicable in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.
